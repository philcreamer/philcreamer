ABSTRACT:
Spotify’s increasing popularity as a music streaming service posits itself as an intermediator between the consumers and the musical realm, which encompasses every instance of musical engagement also know as musicking. Spotify’s methods of content personalization are similar to platforms who retain and re-incorporate user information for product development, using methods such as habitual user feedback and social media integration. 
Data tracking methods implemented by Spotify are facilitated by the use of algorithms which affect traditional forms of musicking, such as musical discovery methods. This causes a paradigm shift in the ways music associates among itself and its encompassing ecosystem, much like its technological adoption of analogous to digitized forms of media, and through reintegrating methods such as user feedback, taste preferences and genre similarities, to name a few. 
Algorithmic elements pertain to numerical aggregation, which is utilized to compare and reinforce artist status popularity, followings and ranking, among the Spotify platform which therefore materializes into the public sphere. In addition to Spotify’s increasing use and popularity are the growing concerns of platform capitalism; Spotify’s use of personal data to be reintegrated back into its infrastructure for the return of increased use, attention, and consumption while acting as the leading example for corporatized digital music streaming models. 
It is argued that Spotify’s algorithmic influence plays an important role in forming and reinforcing notions of popularity, ranking and hierarchy, also factors that coordinate the corporatized music industry. Through the use of new media digital tools, it is, therefore, possible to observe the Spotify’s algorithmically formulated qualitative and quantified results, which are made viable through Spotify’s technical affordances.
